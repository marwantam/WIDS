###Machine Learning WiFi Intrusion Detection System using Random Forest and AWID3 Dataset.
The work done was for my bachelor's project. 

##SETUP
To start using this code you'll need to first download the AWID3 dataset.

To do so head to their official website and request the dataset.

Email reply is typically sent in a day or two.

Open up the code in your preffered editor, and change the path links in each attack section to where you've saved the dataset.
